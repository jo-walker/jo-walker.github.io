                        Databases are used to store data and are a core component of many information technology systems. Students learn the fundamentals of relational databases design using Entity Relation Diagrams (ERDs), and use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, modify and query a database. Students design and create databases that are maintainable, secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using normalization. Students become familiar with the functions of a Database Management System (DBMS) and its components in comparison with legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.
